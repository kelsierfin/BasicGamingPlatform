Use Case 1: Challenge Players

Iteration: 1, last modification: March 5th by Sage

Primary Actor: Registered Player

Goal in context: Allow a registered player to challenge another player to a match in an available board game

Preconditions: 
1. The user is logged into their account
2. The user has an active internet connection
3. The opponent they wish to challenge must also be a registered user and online
4. The game server must be running
5. At least one game must be available for selection

Trigger: The player selects the option to challenge another player from the GUI

Scenario: 
1. The player navigates to the "Challenge Players" section in the GUI
2. The system displays a list of available online players
3. The player selects an opponent from the list
4. The system prompts the player to select a game from the available options
5. The player selects a game and confirms the challenge
6.The system sends a challenge request to the selected opponent
7.The opponent receives a notification of the challenge
8.The opponent either accepts or declines the challenge
9.If accepted, the system initializes the game and directs both players to the game lobby
10.If declined, the system notifies the challenger of the declined request
Post conditions:
1. If the challenge is accepted, both players enter the game lobby, ready to start the match
2. If the challenge is declined, the challenger is returned to the "Challenge Players" screen

Exceptions:
1. The opponent goes offline before responding: the system must notify the challenger and cancels the challenge, sending the user 2. back to the game lobby
3. The game server is unavailable or down: the system must inform the user and prevent challenges from being sent or game selection
4. The opponent is already in another match: the system must notify the challenger and direct them back to the screen of online players
5. The challenger cancels the request before the opponent responds: the system must withdraw the challenge and cancel the challenge notification to the opponent

Priority: High, this feature is essential for multiplayer games and direct player interaction and matchmaking

When available: This feature is always accessible to players in the GUI once they are logged in and connected to the game server

Frequency of use: Every time a player logs in to the server and wants to play a game with another user online

Channel to actor: The player interacts through the GUI by selecting from the options to challenge another player who is online

Secondary actors: 
1. Opponent Player (receives the challenge and chooses whether to accept)
2. Game Server (handles matchmaking and game initialization)

Channel to secondary actors:
1. Opponent Player: receives an in-game notification
2. Game Server: Processes and maintains server status, game availability and matchmaking status for players

Open issues:
1. Multiple incoming challenges to the same player
2. Ability to block another user to avoid receiving challenge requests from them
3. Timeout  mechanism for responding to challenges to prevent inactive or AFK players from slowing matchmaking times
4. Having a friends list of specific players you frequently play with
