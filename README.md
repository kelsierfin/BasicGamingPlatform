# Online Multiplayer tictactoe.gamelogic.server.Board Game Platform

Welcome to the **Online Multiplayer tictactoe.gamelogic.server.Board Game Platform (OMG)**! This project aims to provide a framework where users can:

1. Register, log in, and manage personal profiles  
2. Match with other players using a matchmaking system  
3. Play several board games (e.g., Chess, Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four) with real-time or turn-based interactions  
4. Track and compare performance on leaderboards  

**Note**: The real database or fully hosted servers are stubs or placeholders.

## Project Overview

This project is part of an academic assignment for **SENG300**. It involves designing and implementing an online platform where players can discover and join multiple board games under one system. While the full hosting and database layers are not implemented, we have created clear stubs and interfaces to show where integration with external services would occur.

### Key Objectives
- Demonstrate **multiplayer** functionality with turn-taking mechanics  
- Provide a **GUI** that players can use to log in, start or join a game, and view leaderboards  
- Showcase **extensible** design so additional games can be integrated in future iterations  
- Include comprehensive **planning, design, and test documentation**

  - **Tic-Tac-Toe** (simple, to validate core features)  
  - **Connect Four** or any other chosen game (for more complex real-time play) 
  - **Go**
