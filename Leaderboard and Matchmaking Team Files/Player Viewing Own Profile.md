Iteration: 1, last modification: Mar 6 by Min Oh
Primary actor: Player
Goal in context: To allow the player to view their personal profile, including their game statistics, ranking, match history, and highest ranked achieved
Preconditions:
    The player has an active and verified account
    The player has played all of their placement game(s) and received a ranking

    Current ranking and rank title
    W/L ratio
    Recent match history
    Total games played
    The player clicks on any one of the options above and each options will display its own features (i.e. when clicked on recent match history it will show the player and opponent name and ranking, results, match duration)
Exceptions:
    If there is a server issue or missing data, the system displays an error message and prompts the player to retry
    If the player hasnâ€™t played any ranked matches but has played casual matches, the system will display an unranked status and statistics for casual matches will be provided and vice versa
